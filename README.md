All the program are written in c program language. Java version of this sorting and searching will there soon


## Sorting 
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
<p>

The choice of sorting algorithm depends on various factors, including the size of the dataset, the degree of pre-sorting, stability requirements, and the available memory. Merge sort and quicksort are often preferred for general-purpose sorting in larger datasets, while simpler algorithms like bubble sort and insertion sort may be suitable for smaller datasets or partially sorted lists.
